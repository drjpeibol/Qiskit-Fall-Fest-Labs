    "The Qiskit Fall Fest is an awesome event, happening on your campus, with your classmates and friends. But this is just one small part of the entire Qiskit ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Qiskit** is open-source software for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers, regardless of their skill level or area of interest; Qiskit allows anyone to easily design experiments and applications and run them on real quantum computers or classical simulators. Qiskit is already in use around the world by beginners, hobbyists, educators, researchers, and commercial companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental unit of Qiskit is the **quantum circuit**, which is a series of instructions that a quantum computer can use to work with quantum bits of information, also known as **qubits**. These qubits have special properties that enable quantum computers to approach problems differently than how your laptop or iPhone might. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're breezing through this overview because, honestly, we could spend hours just explaining the basics of quantum information and computation. In fact, IBM Quantum has done this already, producing a [written course](https://learn.qiskit.org/course/basics/single-systems) and a series of [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvqKKMXX4vbi4EB1uaErFMSO) devoted to the topic. If you need a refresher, check them out!\n",
    "\n",
    "So back to Qiskit. A basic workflow using Qiskit consists of two stages: **Build** and **Execute**. Build allows you to make different quantum circuits that represent the problem you are solving, and Execute allows you to run those quantum circuits on different backends, including simulators, which is what we're be using. After the jobs have been run, the data is collected for you to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first part, we're going to build a simple circuit, and execute it on a simulator. We tend to use simulators during tutorials because they can run instantly. IBM has dozens of quantum computers that can be accessed via the cloud, but *because* anyone around the world can use them, there are sometimes wait times. Let's avoid that and begin!"

    "Great! So when we measure the qubits, we knock them out of any unique quantum state they may be in. When we measure a qubit, we get a classical bit of data, a zero or a one. That's why we include the classical bits when we create a new `QuantumCircuit()` object. \n",

Nevertheless, simulators are very useful tools for designing smaller quantum circuits.\n",

    "The number on the left (000) is called a **key**, and the number on the right (1024) is a called a **value**. The key tells us what each of our three qubits got measured as, and the value is the number of times that specific result was measured. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Why did we measure the exact same thing - '000' - every time?* \n",
    "By convention, qubits always start in the state 0. This is their ground state. To change a qubit's state, you need to add energy to it. You can do this by adding various gates to the circuit. When you add gates to the circuit, you start changing the value of the qubit. Since we aren't adding any gates to our three qubits, the result stays zero for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Why did we run this circuit 1024 times?* \n",
    "Quantum computers are still very new, and can have randomness in their results. It's common to repeat your circuit a few times (or a few hundred) to compare your results. This circuit was repeated 1024 times, which is the default number of times to repeat a circuit in Qiskit. "

    "## Part 2: Using Gates \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers can use \"gates\" to send different instructions to the qubits. Let's look at three commonly used gates:\n",
    "\n",
    "First up, we have what is known as a NOT gate. This is one of the most basic operations that you can do in a computer; it simply flips the bit value. A 0 becomes 1, or a 1 becomes 0. We use a gate known as the X gate, `.x()` for this, writing the target qubit number inside the parenthesis. This is commonly referred to by either name, an X or a NOT gate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's look at something uniquely quantum, the Hadamard gate. This gate puts a qubit into a superposition, which hopefully you've already learned in one of your Fall Fest workshops! We can apply a hadamard gate simply, by using `.h()` and writing the target qubit number inside the parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last gate we'll look at for now is the CNOT gate. There's a lot of ways to examine what this gate is or what it does. To keep it simple, let's say that this is the entanglement gate. It entangles two qubits together. We apply a CNOT gate by using `.cx()` and writing the two qubit numbers in the parenthesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Time to see each of these in action:"
